Good news - there are lots of places that describe x86 assembly, and Linux
uses in particular.

- <http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/libc/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/i386/sysdep.h?cvsroot=glibc>
  The glibc sysdep.h; it has a lengthy comment describing the two ways of
  making a syscall under Linux. (sysenter is apparently much faster when
  available.)

- <http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/531/1996>
  Linux's VSYSCALL method for determining the fastest available method.
  I don't think I can use it as-is; it doesn't mark which instruction
  actually executes the system call, which I of course need for safety.

- <http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/brennan/brennan_att_inline_djgpp.html>
  This page describes inline assembly syntax. It's probably easiest to do
  stuff in C with inline assembly here (that's what glibc does). Though I'm
  sure I could find plenty of documentation on the function call conventions.

- <http://linuxassembly.org/>

- <http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/>
  dietlibc - has a bunch of syscalls in raw assembly

- <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/dahlin/Classes/UGOS/labs/lab2/gcc-calling-notes.pdf>
  Describes gcc calling conventions

- <http://www.netwinder.org/~patb/elf_relocs.html>
  Describes ELF relocations, particularly with respect to i386.
