The files in this directory are .h files with doxygen comments only ---
major sections of the documentation. They're in separate files for clarity and
to avoid unnecessary recompiles when they're changed.

I'm using doxygen exclusively for this project because I like having all of
the documentation right under one umbrella with extensive cross-references.
doxygen even makes the function calls in the examples into hyperlinks.
